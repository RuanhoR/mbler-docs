# Command usage

This page lists common commands, formats, aliases, and brief descriptions of mbler. Most commands need to be set up or go to the working directory first (see 'checkout / -c'). If you run commands frequently in your dev repository, it is recommended to use 'npm link' to link your local mbler to global commands (see tips below).

Important
- If you are still using `node index.js<cmd>`, it is recommended to run npm link in the root directory of the repository, and then you can use `mbler <cmd>`.
- Features marked as {BETA} are experimental/imperfect, please use them with caution and feedback questions.

Command overview

| Command | Usage | Alias | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| checkout | `mbler checkout <PATH | null>` | -c | set or view the working directory. Current working directory is displayed when 'null' is passed; The incoming directory path switches to that directory (relative/absolute paths are supported).
| build | `mbler build` | --- | Package the current working directory (build behavior package/resource).
| init | `mbler init` | `-i` | Initialize the project skeleton in the current working directory (interactive).
| version | `mbler version` | — | Displays the version of the current working directory item (version in the package or MBLER configuration).
| v | `mbler v` | `-v` | Displays the version of the MBLER tool itself
| clean | `mbler clean` | `cln` | Clean up temporary files and output traces generated by the build
| web_edit | `mbler web_edit` | — | {BETA} Launches the local web code editor (experimental feature).
| install | `mbler install <git-url | local path >` | — | Install/pull a script dependency package from the specified git repository or local path to the local dependency repository
| add | `mbler add<package-name>` | | Add a declaration of installed dependencies in the configuration of the current working directory (add the dependencies to the project reference).
| remove | `mbler remove<package-name>` | — | Remove dependency claims from the current working directory configuration (do not delete installed packages).
| uninstall | `mbler uninstall<package-name>` | | Delete the installed dependency package (removed from the dependency repository).
| dev | `mbler dev` | — | Enable development mode: listen to source code changes and compile/build in real time (for local debugging).
| recache | `mbler recache` | — | Reset cache |
| help | `mbler help<命令名>` | — | See help for the command |
| lang | `mbler lang' <语言名>`| — | switch language |
| create | `mbler create <git repo | dir | npm package>` | — | Initialize according to the template script, similar to `npm create` |
Common examples

- Toggle/view the working directory
```bash
# Switch to the MyProject directory and make it your current working directory
mbler checkout ./myproject
# checkout is too long, -c is recommended
mbler -c ./myproject

# Check the current working directory
mbler -c
```

- Initialize the project (perform interactive initialization in the current working directory)
```bash
cd ./myproject && mbler -c ./
mbler init
```
- Switch languages
```bash
# Switch to Chinese Simplified, others en English 
mbler lang zh
mbler help lang
```
- Build
```bash
# Build the current working directory
mbler build
```

- Install and manage dependencies
```bash
# Install dependencies from a remote git repository (pull packages into local dependencies repositories)
mbler install https://github.com/owner/dep-repo.git
# Local path installation (commonly used in development)
mbler install .. /local-dep
# Declare installed dependencies in the project (add them to the project configuration)
mbler add gameLib
# Remove dependency declarations from the project configuration
mbler remove gameLib
# Uninstall installed dependency packages (removed from local dependency repositories)
mbler uninstall gameLib
```

- Development with thermal heavy loads
```bash
# Enter development mode to automatically listen and build
mbler dev
```

Other Notes and FAQs
- npm link related: After executing `npm link`, make sure that the global npm bin is in the system PATH. Linux/macOS can be confirmed with `which mbler` and Windows can be confirmed with 'where mbler'.
- Command context: Most commands (such as build, add, remove, version) rely on the current working directory (checkout point), make sure to bind the working directory to `mbler -c ./` before using it.
- web_edit is an experimental feature
