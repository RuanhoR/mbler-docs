mbler provide a modular system. This is a use on Minecraft Script api (next, I may support mcfunction modular system).
The feature is in development.
I plan for the feature:
spilt command: mbler-module

command: 
  - install [package] - install the package
  - add [package] - add this package in this mbler work dir  

the [package] 
  - xxx@xxx:/xxx | https://xxx | ssh://xxx:xxx/xxx find it as url
  - xx/xx find by localhost
  - xxx find from npm
